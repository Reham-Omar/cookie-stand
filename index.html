      <h4>About Pat's Cookies</h4>
        <p> Pat came up with a the idea for Salmon Cookies by combining two signature Seattle icons: Coffee, and Salmon! Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies.
        </p>
        <p>They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually are made with real Salmon! The fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it! This is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. This wonderful addition to the great, (though admittedly odd at times) Seattle Culture that Tourists will go gaga for!
